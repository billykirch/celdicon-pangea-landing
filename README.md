# Fundraising Landing Page — Pangea-SS by Celdicon

## React + TypeScript + Vite

This site was initialized with Vite using React (Typescript variant) as the framework.

## Local Setup

After cloning the repository, check that your version of Node.js is up to date (Vite usually expects v18+):
```bash
node -v
npm -v
```
In the project directory, make sure node is installed:
```bash
npm install
```
To start the development server, run the following command—Vite should take care of the rest:
```bash
npm run dev
```
Open the project url that appears in the terminal to view the page in your browser.
